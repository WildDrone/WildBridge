## Overview

WildBridge is an open-source Android application that extends DJI's Mobile SDK V5 to provide accessible telemetry, video streaming, and low-level control for scientific research applications. Running directly on the DJI remote controller, it exposes network interfaces (HTTP and RTSP) over a local area network, enabling seamless integration with ground stations and external research tools.

- **Real-time Telemetry**: Publishing drone states as ROS topics
- **RTSP Video Streaming**: Live video feed integration with ROS Image messages
- **Command Interface**: ROS service calls for drone control
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Automatic drone detection via MAC address lookup

#### Package Structure
```

├── dji_controller/          # Main drone control package
│   ├── controller.py        # ROS node for drone commands and telemetry
│   └── dji_interface.py     # HTTP interface wrapper
├── drone_videofeed/         # RTSP video streaming package

└── wildview_bringup/        # Launch configuration
    └── swarm_connection.launch.py  # Multi-drone launch file
```

#### ROS Topics

**Published Topics** (per drone):
- `/drone_N/speed` - Current velocity magnitude
- `/drone_N/location` - GPS coordinates (NavSatFix)
- `/drone_N/attitude` - Pitch, roll, yaw
- `/drone_N/battery_level` - Battery percentage
- `/drone_N/video_frames` - Live camera feed (Image)

**Subscribed Topics** (commands):
- `/drone_N/command/takeoff` - Takeoff command
- `/drone_N/command/goto_waypoint` - Navigate to coordinates
- `/drone_N/command/gimbal_pitch` - Gimbal control

#### Usage Example
```bash
# Launch multi-drone system
ros2 launch wildview_bringup swarm_connection.launch.py

# Send takeoff command
ros2 topic pub /drone_1/command/takeoff std_msgs/Empty

# Navigate to waypoint [lat, lon, alt, yaw]
ros2 topic pub /drone_1/command/goto_waypoint std_msgs/Float64MultiArray "{data: [49.306254, 4.593728, 20.0, 90.0]}"

# Monitor telemetry
ros2 topic echo /drone_1/location
```

This ROS2 implementation showcases how WildBridge's HTTP API can be wrapped for integration with existing robotics frameworks, enabling seamless multi-drone coordination in research applications.

## Scientific Applications

WildBridge has been validated in multiple research domains:

- **Wildlife Conservation**: Real-time animal detection and geolocation
- **Wildfire Detection**: Early fire detection and mapping
- **Atmospheric Research**: Wind field profiling and measurement
- **Multi-drone Coordination**: Swarm-based data collection
- **Conservation Monitoring**: Long-term ecosystem studies

## Limitations and Considerations

### Technical Limitations
- **Video Scalability**: Maximum 6 concurrent video streams
- **Telemetry Rate**: Optimal performance up to 32Hz request rate
- **Synchronization**: Video and telemetry streams are not synchronized
- **SDK Dependency**: Relies on DJI Mobile SDK V5 evolution

### Operational Considerations
- **Setup Time**: Multi-drone configurations require network setup
- **Environmental Factors**: Performance affected by Wi-Fi interference
- **Data Synchronization**: Post-mission data alignment requires planning

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Problems**:
- Verify RC IP address in network settings
- Ensure WildBridge app is running and Virtual Stick enabled

**Video Stream Issues**:
- Test RTSP URL in VLC: `rtsp://aaa:aaa@{RC_IP}:8554/streaming/live/1` (Open Network Protocol, Ctrl+N)
- Check network bandwidth for multiple streams
- Verify firewall settings on ground station

**Waypoint Navigation Issues**:
- If you send a drone to a waypoint but it does not move, ensure that Virtual Stick is enabled. You can enable Virtual Stick in the DJI App or send a command to enable it. Once enabled, the drone should be able to move to the waypoint.

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test connectivity
ping {RC_IP}

# Test video stream
vlc rtsp://aaa:aaa@{RC_IP}:8554/streaming/live/1

# Monitor telemetry
curl http://{RC_IP}:8080/aircraft/allStates
```
